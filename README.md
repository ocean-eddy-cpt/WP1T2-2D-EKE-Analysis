# along-track-altimetry-analysis
This repository contains code written to parse and analyze along-track sea surface height measurements collected by various altimeters missions. Data are accessed on Pangeo and processed to explore spatial and temporal variability along each satellite track. altimetry_tools.py contains the functions called by the master function global_along_track.ipynb.

For purposes of recreating figures and analysis described in "On the Observed Seasonality of the Mesoscale Inverse Cascade in the Global Ocean", global_along_track.ipynb is the reference notebook. This notebook is heavily annotated to describe analysis procedures and considers the effect of different spatial filter kernel choices (taper, Gaussian, boxcar). In addition, we filter cross-track geostrophic velocites using a spatially varying filter scale equal to the length in kilometers of 1 degree of longitude. This is done to provide maps of mean and eddy kinetic energy with a resolution equal to a global climate model. Seasonality is considered, specifically what fraction of seasonally varying kinetic energy is 'lost' when filtering to 1 degree.
